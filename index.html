        <h2 style="background color: purple; font-size: 30px; color: white;">About me</h2>
             <p style="font-size: 15px; color: white;">I am Australian with a British background, my mother was born in Manchester, United Kingdom before
                immigrating to Australia with my grandparents and Aunties and Uncles. English is my first and only language.
                My education has been varied, I have a Bachelor of Business (Management), I also have a certificate in Medical
                Administration, a Certificate III in Customer Contact, I am a green belt in the Lean Six Sigma program and I
                also a Salesforce Certified Administrator 201.  I have a big fluffy ginger cat named Fred and in my spare time
                you will find me drinking too much coffee and reading as many books as I can.</p>
       <h2 style="background color: purple; font-size: 30px; color: white;">Interest in IT</h2>
          <p style="font-size: 15px; color: white;">My interest in IT was really caused by my current job, my role is to implement new ideas/initiatives to my
             department that enable us to work better/faster/cheaper.  In the last few years, I have really been focused on
             IT solutions. This has really re ignited my interest in IT and led me to want to continue my studies.
             I am now a Salesforce Certified Administrator 201 as I have been working on Salesforce solutions for the last
             2 years.</p>

          <p style="font-size: 15px; color: white;">I chose to come to RMIT through Open Universities, I did my own research on what course might be best suited to me
             and when I discussed it with the OU student advisor they said that this course on the online format is what would
             suit my interests best and my schedule.  I have done short courses with RMIT before and had a positive experience.
             So, I was happy to go ahead with this recommendation. </p>

          <p style="font-size: 15px; color: white;">I expect to learn the foundations of IT and be able to consolidate and further the knowledge I already have.
             I expect that upon graduation I will have gained a combination of knowledge and practical skills to be able to
             make a living in the stream of IT I choose.</p>

        <h2 style="background color: purple; font-size: 30px; color: white;">Ideal Job</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 15px; color: white;">My ideal job is a cloud solutions architect, the job is essentially to plan and design cloud environments.  Usually as a
           development or deployment project. A cloud architects can be involved in the entire lifecycle of systems or environments, initial involvement at the
           gather requirements stage of the project and then can potentially be around through to replacement or decommissioning of the system or environment. As a Cloud
           Solutions Architect the job is to understand the business needs and what functionality is required, how it functions and what cost it might incur upfront and ongoing.
           This job in particular appeals to me because I enjoy working on projects and solutions, this job also involves cyber security which is an area of IT that I desire
           to learn more in and would ideally like to have involved heavily in my career going forward.
           The skills and experience I will need to be able to be able to secure a job like this one would be firstly strong knowledge cloud ecosystems and cloud security.
           Experience in designing and implementing cloud solutions, most likely within a consulting company and experience in delivering projects.
           I currently have experience in delivering projects, I also have strong customer service skills having worked in retail, call centres and as front of house (reception)
           in my previous roles.  I believe these skills combined with further study and IT qualifications will help me get started in the career path required to eventually
           end up with this ideal job or similar.
           My plan to achieve this ideal job begins with starting a bachelor’s degree in information technology at RMIT.  While completing my studies I plan to enrol in a
           mentoring program such as ‘Women in Digital’ which is a government mentoring program connecting aspiring female IT students and/or early in their career to
           established women in IT. After graduation I plan to seek a job in consultancy firm as a junior member of the IT consultancy teams.  I would use my team here
           to gain experience in providing Cloud Solutions to external clients, this will give me the experience and knowledge in how to scope requirements and deliver a
           solution that suits a business’ needs. </p>

         <h3 style="background color: purple; font-size: 20px; color: white;">Summary and insights</h3>
         <p style="font-size: 15px; color: white;">My Myers-Briggs test results have come back as a Turbulent Entertainer, which to me can be summed up as a negatively inclined extrovert.
          The Big 5 personality test has me scoring the highest in Extroversion and Agreeableness, and the Honey and Mumford learning test advises that the ‘Activist’ style of learning
          is the best for me.   The test results do seem to complement each other, it is agreed across all 3 it appears that I am an extrovert who thrives in social settings. It makes
          sense that my learning style would be one that involves group discussion and roleplaying.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 15px; color: white;"> When working in a team, my social skills will become useful in building relationships with new people, regarding brainstorming being
          original and bold will help me engage and contribute to the team effort. There are a few things I need to be mindful of, firstly that I don’t get distracted and distract others
          as that is something Entertainers are inclined to do. The is to beware of my weaknesses of being conflict adverse and being too ‘agreeable’, This has led me in the past to not
          speaking up in previous group projects when I do not agree with team decisions such as division of work etc. I also feel the weakness of being sensitive could become hard when
          accepting constructive feedback form my teammates. </p>
          <p style="font-size: 15px; color: white;"> When forming a team, I think that there probably shouldn’t be more than one entertainer.  I think one can be incredibly useful to
          drive social interaction and help build the social connections with your fellow team members.  But two could be double the distraction. I think someone that has the type of
          personality that will keep things on track when I am distracted or trying to engage the team in an unrelated discussion would be useful.  Sometimes us entertainers need to be
          kept in check.
          </p>
          <h2 style="background color: purple; font-size: 30px; color: white;">Project Idea</h2>
          <p style="font-size: 15px; color: white;">My project idea is an android mobile app for managing your plants, both indoor and outdoor.  The app will have the functionality
            for the user to add their plants to the repository in the app, the app will help identify the plant type if unknown or unsure and then will have advice for the plant
            owner, ranging from beginner to advanced gardeners. The final product will include reminders on when to water, light assessment (via phone camera), and a social aspect
            where users can ask advice form other plant aficionados within the app.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 15px; color: white;">Indoor plants are already extremely popular, but in recent years the popularity has grown even further.  ‘Google Trends…has shown
            that interest in the term “indoor plants” has increased significantly in the past 5 years.’ (Why are indoor plants so popular 2018, para 1).  Experts say that indoor plants
            decrease stress levels and reduce the amount of toxins in the air. But we are also leading increasingly busy lives and occasionally we do forget about our plant friends,
            until we notice they are looking a bit sad (sometimes too late!). With all these positives an app that helps a budding green thumb not kill they are new green friends
            must be a good idea!  With push notifications coming through to remind users when and how much to water every plant they’ve add to their ‘nursery’ within the app.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 15px; color: white;"> The mobile app will be like a nursery in your pocket. In version 1 (MVP) the app will have the ability to log all plants, what
            plant type they are, approximate size (small, medium, large) and what room in their house the plant is located.  The user will be able to add photos, so they can track
            their plant friend’s growth over their journey and access information regarding the plant species including soil recommendations, sunlight requirements and pet toxicity.
            There will also be an option to turn on push notifications to be reminded to water their plants. Version 2 will start to automate more and more, with the push notifications
            set automatically for every individual plant type and will also include suggested water in millilitres and if needed will recommend re potting for the plants as required.
            We will also include the ability to have the light in the room assessed via the phone’s camera to see if the plant is getting too much/too little sunlight. Version 3 will
            add in a social component, so green thumbs can connect and get advice on their plant friends, if they are just at a lost on why their plants keep dying or why they do not
            seem to be growing they can access social forums only available to other users and post pictures and description of their issue and get advice. This social aspect is
            designed to help likeminded plant parents connect.  But will also expand to include more outdoor gardens including things like a veggie patch, which need much more work
            than most indoor plants species.  For users with the veggie patch function will get seasonal advice on what seeds to plant and when to water and harvest.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 15px; color: white;">I plan to use a tool called ‘Appy Pie’ to build the MVP and make available on the app store with this tool The only hardware required
            will be my own computer for programming, an android device for testing and then users will need to have their own android device as well. </p>
          <p style="font-size: 15px; color: white;">I have chosen to use ‘Appy Pie so that I should be able to build the MVP with my basic knowledge of programming.  Once it is time to
            start working on version 3, I will need to have advanced my knowledge in programming, especially in web development languages like HTML 5 and CSS.  There is extra study I
            can do in app development as well as the skill I am learning through university.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 15px; color: white;">Once successful users will have a solution to managing their indoor and outdoor plants all managed with their phones. It does not
            how busy you are; you will now never forget to look after your plant friends. </p>
