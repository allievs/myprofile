        <h2 style="background color: purple; font-size: 30px; color: white;">About me</h2>
             <p style="font-size: 15px; color: white;">I am Australian with a British background, my mother was born in Manchester, United Kingdom before
                immigrating to Australia with my grandparents and Aunties and Uncles. English is my first and only language.
                My education has been varied, I have a Bachelor of Business (Management), I also have a certificate in Medical
                Administration, a Certificate III in Customer Contact, I am a green belt in the Lean Six Sigma program and I
                also a Salesforce Certified Administrator 201.  I have a big fluffy ginger cat named Fred and in my spare time
                you will find me drinking too much coffee and reading as many books as I can.</p>
       <h2 style="background color: purple; font-size: 30px; color: white;">Interest in IT</h2>
          <p style="font-size: 15px; color: white;">My interest in IT was really caused by my current job, my role is to implement new ideas/initiatives to my
             department that enable us to work better/faster/cheaper.  In the last few years, I have really been focused on
             IT solutions. This has really re ignited my interest in IT and led me to want to continue my studies.
             I am now a Salesforce Certified Administrator 201 as I have been working on Salesforce solutions for the last
             2 years.</p>

          <p style="font-size: 15px; color: white;">I chose to come to RMIT through Open Universities, I did my own research on what course might be best suited to me
             and when I discussed it with the OU student advisor they said that this course on the online format is what would
             suit my interests best and my schedule.  I have done short courses with RMIT before and had a positive experience.
             So, I was happy to go ahead with this recommendation. </p>

          <p style="font-size: 15px; color: white;">I expect to learn the foundations of IT and be able to consolidate and further the knowledge I already have.
             I expect that upon graduation I will have gained a combination of knowledge and practical skills to be able to
             make a living in the stream of IT I choose.</p>
